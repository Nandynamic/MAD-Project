## 3. Problem Statement
Managing group expenses (for trips, shared hostels, parties, or outings) is often confusing and time-consuming. People either forget who paid what or end up doing complex manual calculations, which leads to misunderstandings and financial disputes. There is a need for a simple, mobile-first solution to handle group expense sharing effectively.

## 4. Proposed Solution / Idea
A mobile application built with React Native that allows users to add group expenses, automatically split costs among members, and calculate who owes whom. The app will provide an easy interface for tracking, settling, and visualizing expenses.

## 5. Key Features
- Create groups for different trips or events  
- Add expenses (who paid and for what)  
- Auto-calculate and split expenses among members  
- Settlement reminders and notifications  
- Expense history and monthly spending insights  
- Option to export/share settlement report  

## 6. Target Users / Audience
Students, roommates and friends who share group expenses (trips, rent, food, events).  

## 7. Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React Native (with React Navigation)  
- **Backend:** Firebase / Node.js (Express for APIs if needed)  
- **Database:** Firebase Firestore  
- **Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging  
- **Optional:** Charts.js or Victory Native for expense visualization  

## 8. Expected Outcome
A fully functional cross-platform mobile app where users can easily manage shared expenses, track group spending, and resolve settlements without confusion.

## 9. Timeline
- Week 1–2: UI/UX design, group & user management  
- Week 3–4: Expense creation & auto-split logic  
- Week 5: Notifications and reporting features  
- Week 6: Expense insights & charts  
- Week 7: Testing, security & deployment  

## 10. Additional Notes
Future scope includes integration with UPI/Paytm/Google Pay for direct settlements and OCR support to scan bills automatically.
